# MusicApp

MusicApp is a platform designed to manage and organize a music collection. You can save information about audio tracks and create playlists. This is achieved through an API interface built using FastAPI, Uvicorn and Pydantic, which communicates with a database.
The platform is divided into three components, each running in its own Docker container: database, frontend and backend. Each component runs in isolation. The database stores all the information, the frontend provides a user interface using streamlit library. The backend acts as a bridge, handling the communication between the two.
